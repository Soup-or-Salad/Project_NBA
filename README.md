Do certain states produce more and bigger NBA stars? Is basketball played differently in different areas of the country, and if so do different skill sets define what a star player is?

In this project our goal is to combine multiple data sets that show which states have procuced the most standout NBA players over the past 5 seasons. We will then look at those players and their individual skill sets (are they known for scoring, assisting, rebounding, defensive accumen, or avoiding turning the ball over). Using these stats we will also try to paint a picture of why these players are considered to be elite.

## EXAMPLES OF MAP IDEAS

A clear representation of the data could work using (https://observablehq.com/@d3/hexbin-map) for [Hex examnple]("https://github.com/Soup-or-Salad/Project_NBA/blob/main/Images/Hex.png). But this nytimes interactive chart could be very engaging and MAYBE after some looking into it a combination of the two.
